    <h1>The Saleable Seven&#8482;</h1>
    <p>In its entirety, drip marketing blends the concepts of direct customer
      contact (DCC) and strategic follow-up planning (SFP). Over a specific period
      of time, prospective customers are provided with multiple supplements of
      information, which bolster name recognition and reinforce a particular
      theme. The ultimate goal of a drip marketing campaign is long-term business
    growth. </p>
    <p>For larger corporations, drip marketing initiatives are generally beholden
      to the “Law of 29,” a theory that focuses on contacting potential clients
      on 29 different occasions. Advertising campaigns of this nature are very
      elaborate and, more often than not, too expensive for small-to-medium sized
      companies. </p>
    <p>At Badger Wordsmith, LLC, our revolutionary Saleable Seven&#8482; drip marketing
      model is premised on seven targeted customer contacts. As a discount marketing
      house, BWS prides itself on developing cost effective materials for traditional
      or tailor made drip- sensible proposals. The Saleable Seven&#8482; drip marketing
      concept gives entrepreneurs access to cost effective advertising solutions
      previously beyond their financial reach. </p>
    <p>Current economic trends illustrate why reasonably priced alternatives
      to traditional advertising methods are growing in popularity. The Kansas
      City Federal Reserve Bank’s <em>Economic Review</em>, published in the
      second quarter of 2007, reports that businesses consisting of fewer than
      20 employees accounted for almost 80 percent of net new jobs created between
      1990 and 2003. However, many small companies find it impractical to employ
      a full-time marketing and/or communications specialist. As a result, DCC
      and SFP activities are either under utilized or virtually non-existent. </p>
    <p>During these challenging financial times, it is no longer necessary to
      stand on the sidelines. Instead, give Badger Wordsmith, LLC a call, and
      let our Saleable Seven&#8482; drip marketing initiative get your company
      back into the game before it’s too late to score. </p>
