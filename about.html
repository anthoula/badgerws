      seeking to grow their businesses. In some instances, Badger Wordsmith,
      LLC’s prices are up to 70 percent less than other marketing or advertising
      companies. So why pay more and get less? Plus, the BWS customer service
      model is second to none. As a small company, there are no phone trees to
      navigate. A call to Badger Wordsmith, LLC is answered or returned by a
      quality representative. <br />
